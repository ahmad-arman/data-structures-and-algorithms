# Singly Linked List
A linked list is a linear data structure similar to an array. However, unlike arrays, elements are not stored in a particular memory location or index. Rather each element is a separate object that contains a pointer or a link to the next object in that list.

## Challenge
add method  to insert value in linked list <br>
add method to include value in linked list and return true if exist and false if not exist 

## Approach & Efficiency
time O(n) <br>
space O(1)


## API


Inserting a new node before the head (at the beginning of the list).<br>
Include a value in the lined list if yes return true if no return no.<br>
toString all of values and return as look like this `"{ 9 } -> { 8 } -> { 7 } -> { 6 } -> { 5 } -> NULL"`
